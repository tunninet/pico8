upgrade:
  - |
    Operators using ironic-neutron-agent with ``noauth`` authentication
    strategy (i.e standalone ironic without keystone) must update the
    configuration. Replace ``[ironic]/auth_strategy = noauth`` with
    ``[ironic]/auth_type = none`` and set the ``[ironic]/endpoint_override``
    option accordingly.
deprecations:
  - |
    With the switch from ironicclient to openstacksdk the following options has
    been deprecated.

    * ``[ironic]/ironic_url`` replaced by ``[ironic]/endpoint_override``
    * ``[ironic]/os_region`` replaced by ``[ironic]/region_name``
    * ``[ironic]/retry_interval`` replaced by ``[ironic]/status_code_retries``
    * ``[ironic]/max_retries`` replaced by ``[ironic]/status_code_retry_delay``
    * ``[ironic]/auth_strategy`` is **ignored**, please use
      ``[ironic]/auth_type`` instead.
other:
  - |
    Communication with ironic is now using openstacksdk, removing the dependency
    on ironicclient.
